highnoon is a playfull.com points auto collector. This program will allow you to automatically collect your points every 5 minutes. This is useful when you're running a bot to play LoL games and this will allow you to profit even more.

## Installation & Usage

To run this bot, you'll have to install ```Python 3.9.x```. Then run ```pip install selenium``` and edit the login.py file and edit your username and password at the bottom of the code. Download the appropripate chromedriver.exe corresponding to your browser, and place the ```chromedriver.exe``` in the same directory as login.py. Then simply run login.py. You can have this run multiple playfull accounts as well.

## Disclaimer

This tool was made since Playfull has a cap on points that you can earn. Since some of us forget to collect the points, it'll hit the max capacity and the excess points will just go to waste. This was developed for educational purposes only. Nevertheless, if you use this, you are doing it at your own risk. You have been warned.

I am not accountable for any of your actions. :D
